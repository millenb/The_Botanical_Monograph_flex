      <div class="layer2">There followed, I could not quite make out how, a recollection from very early youth. It had once amused my father to hand over a book with coloured plates (an account of a journey through Persia) for me and my eldest sister to destroy. Not easy to justify from the educational point of view! I had been five years old at the time and my sister not yet three; and the picture of the two of us blissfully pulling the book to pieces (leaf by leaf, like an <a href="crucifers2.html">artichoke</a>, I found myself saying) was almost the only plastic memory that I retained from that period of my life.</div>
